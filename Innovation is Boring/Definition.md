# 1. This is My Definition of Innovation
---
Innovation is the process and the outcome in which people implement and apply a set of ideas, methods, and elements in a way that has not been done priorly. Innovation is relative and temporary. What might long be the reality for one person or organisation can be very novel for another. What might have been considered as innovation a short while ago can be the conventional very soon. Today, most innovation is undertaken within corporate organisations with the aim to compete for profit. The common view tells that successful innovation solves a problem. If you demonstrate that you solve a problem which people experience, they will long for the solution you present. If you display that you can fulfill an unresolved need better than everythin that people use instead to help them get it addressed, then they’ll prefer what ‚you have to offer. The underlying assumption: You solve a problem or better fulfill a need and you create added value. If you create added value, you will have a base for entrepreneurial exploitation. This is why corporate organisations that have a strategic approach to innovation heavily engage in understanding present or future problems we experience (or will experience) in all facettes of our society.
