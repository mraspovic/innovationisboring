The best-practice in product development might conflict with the best-practices of academic stakeholders. The success of a joint venture depends on the ability of communicating user research clearly and precisely.

How to Get the Buy-in for the User Research Methodology From Academic Stakeholders?
# Why it Matters

Collaboration between industry and science is increasing (source). There are various ways in which this collaboration can take shape. One of the formal types of collaboration are academic spin-offs ([OECD 2019, p. 32](https://www.notion.so/How-to-Get-the-Buy-in-for-the-User-Research-Methodology-From-Academic-Stakeholders-56c2b722d740481e937a4ce9261151bc?pvs=21)). An academic spin-off "*refers to the entrepreneurial route to commercialising knowledge developed by public research*" ([see ibid](https://www.notion.so/How-to-Get-the-Buy-in-for-the-User-Research-Methodology-From-Academic-Stakeholders-56c2b722d740481e937a4ce9261151bc?pvs=21)). In practice, commercialization means that a team of people introduces a new or enhanced product or service to a market with the objective of successful monetarization. A third of the time when industry and science collaborate this route of commercialization is the outcome their joint projects ([Cantner, Kalthaus & Yarullina 2022, p. 15](https://www.notion.so/How-to-Get-the-Buy-in-for-the-User-Research-Methodology-From-Academic-Stakeholders-56c2b722d740481e937a4ce9261151bc?pvs=21)).

In April 2022 I kicked off such collaborative project with a team at the [Universität der Bundeswehr München](https://www.notion.so/How-to-Get-the-Buy-in-for-the-User-Research-Methodology-From-Academic-Stakeholders-56c2b722d740481e937a4ce9261151bc?pvs=21). The [Media for Peace Fellowship](https://www.media-lab.de/en/programs/media-for-peace) is a collaborative coaching and training program in the field of peace-promoting journalism. We brought together a batch of 11 talented professionals from journalism, design and software development and help them create a sophisticated digital prototype for a novel journalistic service that contributes to conflict prevention or resolution. The big vision: by the end of December 2023 we aim to have a core team of enabled founders that are able to carry their researched and tested service to market in form of a new startup. Our collaboration comes in a client-contractor relationship where the university as the scientific domain expert in the field of peace-promoting journalism commissioned the project and we at the [Media Lab Bayern](https://www.media-lab.de/en/) deliver our expertise in digital product development and startup incubation as a service. In other words: as a program manager I had to coach and train these 11 professionals so they can actually realize that bold vision.
# Research or Research

The best-practice in modern product development is built on a methodology carrying the name: lean startup. In summary, lean startup refers to an entrepreneurial strategy that aims for maximizing the rate of iterations through the build-measure-learn-loop while at the same time minimizing the overall time-to-market ([Ries 2017, pp. 8 - 9](https://www.notion.so/How-to-Get-the-Buy-in-for-the-User-Research-Methodology-From-Academic-Stakeholders-56c2b722d740481e937a4ce9261151bc?pvs=21)).[1] In modern product development projects that measuring and learning is done with help of a methodological concept called user research. When doing user research entrepreneurs interview, survey or observe the target group they are developing products or services for. They do this to more effectively align their solution to the needs and use cases of these people. A strong fit between these needs and their solution is the very basis for future economical exploitation. The main objective is to prevent building a product that has no market or use for the people. In our Media for Peace Fellowship we had to equip our fellows with these methodological skills so they can apply them. As usual, we had to explain the methods and coaching plan to our stakeholders before we started out. Therefore, we had to pitch the user research methodology to actual scientific researchers.

Getting stakeholder buy-in is crucial for successful projects. 'A stakeholder in an organization is (by definition) any group or individual who can affect or is affected by the achievement of the organization's objectives' ([Freeman 2010, p. 46](https://www.notion.so/How-to-Get-the-Buy-in-for-the-User-Research-Methodology-From-Academic-Stakeholders-56c2b722d740481e937a4ce9261151bc?pvs=21)). Projects can be seen as temporary organizations ([Lundin & Söderholm, p. 437](https://www.notion.so/How-to-Get-the-Buy-in-for-the-User-Research-Methodology-From-Academic-Stakeholders-56c2b722d740481e937a4ce9261151bc?pvs=21)) and xxx.
# Higher Level Methodologies and Research Objectives

Academic research aims to develop and test scientific theories from empiric inquiry. User research aims to quickly assess the right direction to move forward (lean startup). Speed of step-to-action is key.
# Science and Industry Are Mixing

The annual number of collaborative projects between industry and science is growing ([https://www.slideshare.net/prcommunication/collaboration-between-scienceindustry](https://www.slideshare.net/prcommunication/collaboration-between-scienceindustry)). The research & development budgets of universities grow significantly year-on-year ([https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeltnietzel/2021/02/08/the-19-us-universities-spending-one-billion-or-more-on-r-and-d/](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeltnietzel/2021/02/08/the-19-us-universities-spending-one-billion-or-more-on-r-and-d/), [https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsf21314#data-tables](https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsf21314#data-tables)). At the same time federal funding of R&D projects is shrinking in general which means that academic players are increasingly focussing on industry to fund their research ([https://www.bu.edu/articles/2015/funding-for-scientific-research/](https://www.bu.edu/articles/2015/funding-for-scientific-research/)). With that comes higher pressure on scientists to produce findings with empirical importance ([https://qz.com/647137/academics-feel-pressure-to-exaggerate-their-researchs-importance](https://qz.com/647137/academics-feel-pressure-to-exaggerate-their-researchs-importance)). Per definition, one way of doing so is by developing something from or in collaboration with research that can be rolled out to the public. Oftentimes, new or enhanced products and services in economic markets stand for fruitful collaboration between industry and science. In practice universities call for project partners and commission contracts for the development part. With the very notion of theory and practice comes the fact that two very different approaches have to meet to create something of value.

# 6. Two Approaches
---
Science still waterfall-ish. Industry is shifting towards lean startup.

1. The problem of buy-in
2. What is out there? → Material does not really help you communicate it to academics
3. What is important in communicating a concept to academics?
4. The issue with the current classifications (all missing the point)
5. My classification: What is user research? And what is it not?
6. From there: Each research communication happens at x steps: Pre-research (pitch), findings, etc.
