The way you communicate and think about your business idea influences your ability to drop it at the point where evidence tells you it doesn't work. Falling to commitment bias has decisive financial impact.
# Definition
---
Commitment bias, also known as the escalation of commitment, describes our tendency to remain committed to our past behaviors, particularly those exhibited publicly, even if they do not have desirable outcomes. The feeling that our future behaviors must align with the things we have said and done in the past severely compromises our ability to make good decisions. This is especially true when our initial decision has led to unfavorable outcomes. Furthermore, it can be problematic when our past behaviors do not align with our current values.

# How to Avoid Falling in Love with a Business Idea

This chapter is inspired by a [similar one](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qERvEVqE-qL5hH4P8hoCw2Y4Ea4cxrea0PQTi80qCMU/edit#heading=h.k6z8hp6n8e6) by the designer and architect Bryan Boyer, which was inspired by the “[two hundred fifty things an architect should know](https://www.readingdesign.org/250-things)” by Michael Sorokin.
## 2.1. How to Avoid Commitment Bias when Testing a New Business Idea

1. frame it as an experiment when talking to others
2. think of multiple scenarios, not just of the best-case
3. create a list of outcomes which are favorable from the worst-case scenario
4. develop concrete follow-up plans for the different scenarios
5. fix make-it-or-break-it decisions and meetings early on, set yourself deadlines
6. use hypotheses and product development frameworks for clean methodology
7. tell yourself and others that things might change at any time
8. if your idea is the answer, what was the question?
9. keep the problem your trying to solve in the foreground
10. communicate that you're aiming to realize the vision. Don't communicate that you're chasing an idea
11. reflect regularly if your behaviour aligns with your goals and values
12. recognize that consistency is not the be-all and end-all
13. don’t make decisions solely based on the desire of consistency
14. focus on the good that will come from changing commitments when necessary
# Practical Prevention Strategies

- Clear decision and stopping rules that are specified in advance (Markovitch et al. 2014, p. 315).
- Scenario planning with estimated enumeration about the impact of a decision under each possible outcome (Markovitch et al. 2014, p. 315).
- Set mental budgets (Yang et al. 2015, p. 703).
# The Role of Culture in Commitiment Biases

## Culture Eats Strategy for Breakfast

Most of the advice is pointing towards a more concious strategic approach towards communicating and thinking about new venture projects. Whenever we talk strategies we have to consider the cultural context in which a strategy is established and pursued. Framing a venturing project as an experiment, for example, might be unsatisfying advice in an organization that pushes for binding predictions about results. Organizational culture and the mindset of the people involved in such projects set the boundaries in which my advice can be effective. Hence, some cultures and mindsets are more prone to commitment bias than others.

Cultures do change - but very slowly. If you are just starting out with your venturing project, be aware of your role in provoking and preventing this costly bias. In a very economical view, your aim should be to lay a cultural foundation that allows and even fosters the above advice to be pursued naturally. Once you locked into commitment bias - conciously or not - it gets highly difficult manoeuvring out again. You might have developed firm (self-) expectations, commitments to stakeholders, and tangible invest. Returning from there most often feels like a failure, is not well-perceived, or is bound to a loss of reputation.

My advice should not be taken as a plea for not taking shots at specific directions or not seeking commitments at all. Rather than that my advice aims for setting a stage where people can rationally experiment and dynamically adjust their approach to their learning in action without professional fear. After all, that is the very essence of successful startup methodology.‍In

German language there is a catchy and effective saying that can be translated into something like:  Foresight is better than hindsight. Avoiding commitment bias is better than tackling it.
# Thoughts about Agile Comms
---
Agile Comms as accompanying concept to lean startup methodology. Turnbull’s concept of agile communication translates the concept of agility to the way people talk about their work. One pillar of his concept is the strategy to communicate in a way that creates the ability to dynamically shift from message to message as work evolves. In his book he criticizes a common communication strategy that is built upon absolute promises and fixed expectations. He doesn’t go into exploring the links between agile comms and commitment bias but I see it here.

Also: In his latter chapters about how to write blogs he gives some valuable thoughts on how to frame my blog.
# 6. Audience of Communication and Commitment Bias
---
Who is the audience in commitment bias contexts? An early-stage startup usually engages with the following stakeholders (sorted by the amount of communication):

1. Co-founders and team
2. Early customers and testers
3. Investors and grants
4. Administration, state, and legal

As Turnbull states, communication must be designed to serve the audience. We must ask: What do these stakeholders need in terms of communication?
# 7. The Implications for Startup Accelerators
---
We speak of commitment bias when people stick to a failing course of actions despite better knowledge. Founders work on a limited set of resources — timewise and financially — which startup language labels as runway. A dazzling number of 81% of US-american and European early-stage startups report a runway of less than 12 months ([January Ventures 2022, p. 9](https://www.january.ventures/_files/ugd/8d7061_91af48de61594b99b1006d37aff09900.pdf)). This means that freshly-baked founders have little to none range of strategic agency once they’re running. If early-stage startup accelerators can reduce the likelihood of commitment bias, they can increase the number of successfull ventures.
# 8. Wordings around Commitment Bias
---
- Effective wording: “Throwing good money after bad”
- Effective wording: “Knowing when to pull the plug”
- Effective wording: “Falling prey to escalation of commitment”
- Effective wording: “In for a penny, in for a pound”
# 9. Financial Implications of Commitment Bias
---
- Problem-solution fit as objective in early-stage startup venturing projects
- Venture runway as lifetime of a venturing project, hence, the boundaries in which commitment bias in startup venturing can occur:
- Rate of iterations as capacity of getting to problem-solution fit
- Higher rate of iteration → higher probability of reaching problem-solution fit
- Higher probability of reaching problem-solution fit → higher probability of venturing success
- What are the enabling factors of iteration capability? (not just hard but also soft?)
# 10. Thoughts about Commitment Bias and Iteration
---
The real issue with commitment bias is that at the point where evidence tells you to iterate, you keep sticking to the path you communicated publicly. The question arises where to iterate in the first place.
## 10.1. User Activity as Proxy for Problem-solution Fit

We start at the underlying thesis that each product or service is a solution to a problem. If a solution solves a problem for a person (better than other solutions), the person will use it (more than other solutions). If a person uses a solution, the solution provider can monetize it.

Therefore, user activity is a working indicator that a solution is solving a problem. Problems can have multiple potential known or yet unknown solutions. One strategic objective of an entrepreneur is to identify the solution that solves the person’s problem as this is the basis for future monetization. If an entrepreneur provides a solution to persons who have a specific problem but they don’t use it, then, this is the indicator that the entrepreneur should iterate towards another solution. Strategically, entrepreneurs in early-stage should always iterate from low usage → high usage.
### 10.1.1. User Activity versus User Acquisition
In order to have user activity an entrepreneur has to acquire users. For early-stage entrepreneurs it’s important to get early users as quickly as possible. Sometimes you see entrepreneurs arguing problem-solution fit through user acquisition KPIs. There is a problem with this. While getting users is the basis for measuring the use of a solution, the amount of users acquired is not a clear indicator for how effective the solution is in solving the problem. A high number of acquired users is usually achieved through effective marketing. User activity and retention on the other hand demonstrates how well the solution sticks with the users once they found out about it. Therefore, user activity should be the only metric used by an entrepreneur to measure problem-solution fit.
# 11. Commitment Bias and Startup Strategy
---
Commitment bias happens when entrepreneurs don’t iterate towards other solutions that have higher user activity even if their user activity metrics show that they should. The underlying reason for this bias is the way entrepreneurs communicate their undertaking to their team, their early users, and investors. This chain of thought leads to the question xxx.
# 12. Deliberate versus Non-deliberate
---
- Per definition commitment bias occurs unreflected and non-deliberate (Flyvbjerg 2021, p. 541 → [https://doi.org/10.1177/87569728211049046](https://doi.org/10.1177/87569728211049046)). Flyvbjerg (2021) presents an example from the film industry where a manager deliberately and strategically triggers the commitment bias in his stakeholders to get through with his undertaking. One can imagine the scenario where an early-stage investor (or business angel) triggers commitment bias in founders in order to feed their get-evenitis (a deliberate form of commitment bias; see Shefrin 1999 chapter get-evenitis → [https://academic.oup.com/book/27607?login=false](https://academic.oup.com/book/27607?login=false)). So, some prevention strategy should also include understanding when environmental and social incluences feed commitment bias and when risk in these settings grow for early-stage founders.
- Academia discussed that a certain level of commitment bias (deliberate or not) might be even positive for entrepreneurial undertakings (for example, see Statman & Caldwell 1987 → [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3666103](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3666103)).

# 13. What Does Academia Say about Commitment Bias
---
1. Commitment bias goes by different names: Escalation of commitment, escalation bias, commitment bias, sunk cost bias, sunk-cost fallacy, or lock-in.

The factors that significantly influence commitment bias fall in one of the three categories (Sleesman et al. 2012, pp. 551-553):

- **Project factors**
    - The more, the less bias
        - Decision risk
        - Presence of opportunity cost information
        - Information acquisition
    - The more, the more bias
        - Decision uncertainty
        - Positive performance trend information
        - Expressed preference for initial decision
- **Psychological factors**
    - The more, the less bias
        - Anticipated regret (!!!)
        - Positive information framing
    - The more, the more bias
        - Sunk costs
            - Even higher, when proximity to project completion is high
        - Time investment (!!!)
        - Decision maker experience or expertise (familiarity → low impact)
        - Self-efficacy or confidence
        - Personal responsibility for the initial decision
            - Even higher, when sunk cost information is available → p. 553
            - Even higher, when decision authority is shared (?) → p. 553
        - Ego threat (!!! → “save face”)
        - Proximity to project completion
            - Even higher, when sunk cost information is available → p. 553
- **Social factors (generally few research → p. 553)**
    - The more, the more bias
        - Group identity or cohesiveness strength
        - Agency problems

**Listed but no significant influence**: (1) Public evaluation of the decision (”saving face”; social factor, the more-the more); (2) Resistance to the decision from others (”accountability through challenges”; social factor, the more-the less); (3) Stronger role in initial decision (”explicitly chosen or assigned”; unknown category, the more-the more)

# 14. What Does Academia Say about Commitment Bias in Entrepreneurship?

→ How does academia define entrepreneurship?

→ Are we talking the same? Who are the entrepreneurs we are talking about?

→ Is there any differentiation with the stage the entrepreneur is at?

→ Who has academia talked to?

→ Are they distinguishing between business owners and founders? (see Markovitch et al. 2014, pp. 302-303)

→ If I use the word founder (like in Yang et al. 2015), the study has been done specifically with founders. If I use the word entrepreneur (like in Markovitch et al. 2014), the study doesn’t clearly distinguish between managers and entrepreneurs.

**On the general stance of academia (entrepreneurship x commitment bias)**
1. Very little destinction between management and entrepreneurship. We have to be very cautious with applying the findings to founders.
2. In order to safe scientifically defined validity, research on commitment bias in entrepreneurship is done by running simulations and labatory experiments. Valid research in field settings with decision-making in failing startups is neither feasible nor reliable as real-life scenarios are flooded with information ambiguity.
3. Getting real entrepreneurs to participate in experiments is hard. Scientists use surrogates like freshly graduated business students. The same was the case with Markovitch et al. (2014) who researched commitment bias behaviors in entrepreneurship-minded groups through management simulation experiments (Markovitch et al. 2014, p. 309). This dilutes the value of scientific findings. The presentation of the sample populations in past research papers about commitment bias in entrepreneurship in more recent overview papers show how wild it get’s about who is counted in as an entrepreneur (Cosette 2014, pp. 468f. → [https://doi.org/10.1080/08276331.2015.1105732](https://doi.org/10.1080/08276331.2015.1105732)).
4. There is always a discussion about when is a startup failing and when is it merely faltering. It doesn’t make too much of a difference in a real-case setting. The shorter a startups runway, the more does faltering align to failure. In scientific methodology it is highly important to be precise on what to measure and how to measure it in order to produce valid findings — therefore this distinction is important but very hard to make. It get’s even muddier when talking media startups. Runway is typically defined as the amount of time that is given by dividing the total amount of resources (per period) through the total costs of operations (per period). What if the total costs of operations comes largely in the form of time invest by the founder. For example, a content startup might only need the workforce of a creator and minor hosting costs for the web presence to operate in full function. If the total amount of time is managed efficiently, a part of the time can be utilized to cover living expenditures (through main income in another role). This levels the operational costs for the content startup to near-zero, thus, extending runway to quasi-unlimited amount of time (in startup language we call this model a side hustle). Aligning with threshold theory,
5. Scholars researching commitment bias in general have been neglecting social factors for project and psychological factors. There is little research on how group decision dynamics influence commitment bias in entrepreneurial teams.
6. Science has been occupied with understanding heuristics in entrepreneurs and founders in general. There is little focus or detailed findings on prevention or de-escalation strategies.

- I sorted out all papers and findings that don’t precisely or clearly show that they have actually done research with and about founders (instead of managers or alike). The next paragraphs only summarize what we know specifically about founders and commitment bias.
- There are strong arguments that people who recently founded a startup think more irrationally (Cooper, Woo & Dunkelberg 1998, pp. 106-108 → [](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0883-9026(88)90020-1)[http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0883-9026(88)90020-1](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0883-9026(88)90020-1); also see Nouri et al. 2018, definition chapter about ‘Nascent Entrepreneurs’). So, are people who found companies more vulnerable to escalation of commitment than others? Scientists have been asking this question for almost 25 years (Baron 1998, p. 288 → [](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0883-9026(97)00031-1)[https://doi.org/10.1016/S0883-9026(97)00031-1](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0883-9026(97)00031-1)). There are weak indicators that people with entrepreneurial intentions bear a higher likelihood of falling to commitment bias (Markovitch et al. 2014, p. 315). Up to this date, science has only come up with slightly significant data that supports this hypothesis. However, Markovitch et al. (2014) found out that people with entrepreneurial intentions bear a higher likelihood of further strengthening commitment bias (Markovitch et al. 2014, p. 315). Within the thinking and decision-making fallacies scientists observed, escalation of commitment is certainly in the top 3 (source?! → one of the overview papers about different biases in entrepreneurs). What does this mean for us? It means that commitment bias is a strategically bad behavior we see in founders. We still don’t have crystal-clear data that shows that founders are more vulnerable to fall prey to commitment bias in the first place but we know once they’re there, they definitively are more prone to escalate further than others.
- Founders that started a tech startup are especially prone to commitment bias (Yang et al. 2015, p. 703).
- New investment allocations are strongly anchored at the magnitude of prior sunk costs → “If I spent more money in my last decision, my next decision will cost relatively the same (own quote)” → “decision makers seem unable to adequately adjust to the minimum investment required to continue the project” (Markovitch et al. 2014, p. 316) → This could mean that entrepreneurs lack skills or tools to effectively (re-) assess their investement decisions.
